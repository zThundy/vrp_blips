Same as blips-for-FiveM, but with vrp permissions check.

Just add to your cfg/groups.lua the permission "admin.blips" and the guys with that Group will be able to do /blips and /names

Some dudes asked me if i could make a free script that, with a command, show blips on the map of all users.

With command /blip, you can trigger the blips on the map and minimap.

With the command /names, you can trigger the names on top of players head. With this is shown also if a player is talking or not.

There also a check if a player is nearby or not, to show the name on the head.
